# Dad Bot
Makes dad jokes

That's all it does
It's not very useful...

The prefix is 'dad'
It also activates when someone starts their message with 'im' or 'i'm' (not case sensitive) and says 'Hi [content after im/i'm], I'm Dad!'.

index.js is the main file.

Node.js 12.0.0 or newer is required.

You need to install discord.js in this directory by typing 'npm install discord.js' in the CLI.

You also need to add a config.json file which contains the token and prefix, like this:

{
	"token": "(place your bot's token here)"
}

The bot can be run by locating the directory and typing 'node .'
